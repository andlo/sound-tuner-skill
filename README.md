## About
This skill plays a sound in the given note or an sound in the given guitar string.
This can be used to tune a musical instruments.

Mycroft is using the even tempered (aka equal tempered) scale, where an octave is a
frequency ratio of exactly two and a semitone is a frequency ratio of exactly the
twelfth root of two. In the real world however many different temperaments may be
used - see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament - and octaves too can vary in
size, see  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretched_octave.

Also Mycroft call middle C for "C4" : this is the commonest octave numbering but some
people call middle C for "C3" or even for "C5".
